## Hold Timer

#### A simple timer built for use when holding calls or chats.

The original goal of the Hold Timer was for timing holds when placing calls or chats on hold.
However, it can still be used for any task that requires you to keep time. The added benefit is that
with the alerts you can be notified after a set time has passed on your timer.

##### Themeable with Default, Monokai, and Spacegray themes included
Themes are configured with simple XML. The Default.xml file can be used as a template to build your own themes.
If you set your own custom colors in Settings, these can be saved directly to a theme from the link below colors in Settings.

##### Quick Holds.
Created a new toolbar that has quick hold buttons of 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and 7 minutes.
Clicking any one of these will create a timer with the title Quick Chat / Call Hold with the alert time set it its respective time frame.
