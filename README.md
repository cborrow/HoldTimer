## Hold Timer

#### A simple timer built for use when holding calls or chats.

The original goal of the Hold Timer was for timing holds when placing calls or chats on hold.
However, it can still be used for any task that requires you to keep time. The added benifit is that
with the alerts you can be notified after a set time has passed on your timer.
